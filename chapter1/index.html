  William Shakespeare's <em>Sonnets</em> consists of 154 poems, each fourteen lines 
  long (three quatrains followed by a rhyming Couplet). 
  Sonnet 18 is perhaps the most famous, and begins like this:
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
      Thou art more lovely and more temperate. 
    </p>  
  </blockquote>
